Running time of normal multiplication of 2 nos of n digits each is O(n^2)

x = 5678
y = 1234

56=a 78=b 12=c 34=d

1. ac = 672
2. bd = 2652
3. (a+b)(c+d) = 134.46 = 6164
4. 3-2-1 = 2840
5. Now we can take results of 1, 2 and 4 and combine them to get x.y
    ac and pad with 4 zeros
    bd. dont pad
    4. pad with 2 zeros
