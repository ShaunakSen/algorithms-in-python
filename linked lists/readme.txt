Comparing with arrays:


Insertion takes const time in ll while linear time in arrays

LL can continue to expand without having to specify size earlier

Arrays have const access time
ll can be linear in worst case



Doubly Linked Lists

These allow greater variety of O(1) time update operations including insertion and deletion

We add a header node at beginning of list
We add trailer node at end of the list
