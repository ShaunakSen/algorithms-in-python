A node is a fundamental part of a tree. It can have a name which we call key
A node may have addnl info which we call payload

An edge connects 2 nodes to show that there exists relationship b/w them

Root is only node with no incoming edges
The level of a node "n" is the no of edges on the path from root node to n

ht = maxm level

If each node has a maxm of 2 children its a binary tree

Recursive Defn : A tree is either empty or consists of a root and zero or more subtrees, each of which
is also a tree
